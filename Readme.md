# Sane Keyboards for macOS

- no silly Unicode characters with Alt (messes with keyboard shortcuts)
- replicates the US PC keyboard layout, with ` in the top left and \ in the bottom left
- uses US/DE flags as keyboard icons instead of generic "A"  
  (macOS uses monochrome icons that automatically become white/black
  depending on background. This capability seems unavailable to
  non-Apple-icns-files.)
